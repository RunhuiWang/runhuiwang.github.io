Miscellaneous
====
I love sports and enjoy professional trainings. 

Since highschool, I've won championships for multiple provincial competitions, and received the Chinese National second-level athelete (Badminton) Certification.

Since college, I've trained myself massively in running and powerlifting:<br>
- finished Beijing International Marathon in 4 hours 33 minutes (despite a sprained ankle);<br>
- participated in Nike University Elite Challenge-Wei Ming Relay (May 2015), and won the 3rd Place;<br>
- joined the First World Renowned Universitiesâ€™ Dragon Boat Competition (Oct 2015), and won the 6th Place in 4000m Race
- personal record: 200kg deadlift with 80kg body weight
