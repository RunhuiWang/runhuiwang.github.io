I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department of __Rutgers University__, advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](http://yongfeng.me/). My current research focus is on large language models and deep learning for data integration. Previously, I worked on similarity search for high dimensional data, advised by [Prof. Dong Deng](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dd903/). I obtained M.Phil. from the __University of Queensland__ (advised by [Prof. Xiaofang Zhou](http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/zxf/) and [Prof. Sibo Wang](http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~swang/)), and B.S. in Computer Science from __Peking University__.

I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services and developed deep learning models for Identity Resolution in 2022. I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at [Megagon Labs](https://megagon.ai/) during the summer of 2021. I was honored to be mentored by [Dr. Yuliang Li](https://oi02lyl.github.io/) and [Dr. Jin Wang](http://yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/~jinwang/).

Miscellaneous
====
I love sports and enjoy professional trainings. 

Since highschool, I've won championships for multiple provincial competitions, and received the Chinese National second-level athelete (Badminton) Certification.

Since college, I've trained myself massively in running and powerlifting:<br>
- finished Beijing International Marathon in 4 hours 33 minutes (despite a sprained ankle);<br>
- participated in Nike University Elite Challenge-Wei Ming Relay (May 2015), and won the 3rd Place;<br>
- joined the First World Renowned Universitiesâ€™ Dragon Boat Competition (Oct 2015), and won the 6th Place in 4000m Race
- personal record: 200kg deadlift with 80kg body weight
